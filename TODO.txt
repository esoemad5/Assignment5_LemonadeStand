This list is not comprehensive!

Low-priority bugs:
Inventory lists can store the wrong item (ex: I can put Ice into my lemons list). Impossible for the user to do, but recklessly changing the code may (unlikely) cause issues with this. Be careful!
PreDayMenu.Display default case happens if 'exit' is entered. The default case for this switch (and probably most others in this project) should never be reached.

Post-MVP:
End of day: # of lemonades sold, customer satisfaction rate, customer feedback table

End of game: How much money is left, how much lemonade sold, customer satisfaction, play again, etc...

PreDayMenu.Display uses 3 columns (one for Inv, Recipe, and Store)

PreDayMenu.message looks funny for the store sometimes.

Item(ingredient, not-food){(lemon, sugar, ice), (cup)} multiple inheritance is no good in C#, but stackOverflow says use interfaces. Look into this.

Put restrictions on recipie (sum of lemons and sugar must be in some range).
