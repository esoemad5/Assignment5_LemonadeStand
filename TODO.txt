This list is not comprehensive!

Low-priority bugs:
Inventory lists can store the wrong item (ex: I can put Ice into my lemons list). Be careful!

Post-MVP:
End of day: # of lemonades sold, customer satisfaction rate, customer feedback table

End of game: How much money is left, how much lemonade sold, customer satisfaction, play again, etc...

PreDayMenu.Display uses 3 columns (one for Inv, Recipe, and Store)

PreDayMenu.Display looks funny for the store.

Item(ingredient, not-food){(lemon, sugar, ice), (cup)} multiple inheritance is no good in C#, but stackOverflow says use interfaces. Look into this.

Put restrictions on recipie (sum of lemons and sugar must be in some range).
