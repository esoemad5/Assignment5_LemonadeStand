This list is not comprehensive!


The game works! Poorly, but it works! Things to make it more than just functional:
Put restrictions on recipie (sum of lemons and sugar must be in some range).
Write message for the 'Help' option.

PreDayMenu.Display can be broken down into more basic functions.


LOOK AT Day CLASS LINE 44


Low-priority bugs (fix after MVP is met):
Inventory lists can store the wrong item (ex: I can put Ice into my lemons list). Be careful!

Item.isAnIngredient is unused.


Post-MVP:
End of day: # of lemonades sold, customer satisfaction rate, customer feedback table

End of game: How much money is left, how much lemonade sold, customer satisfaction, play again, etc...

PreDayMenu.Display uses 3 columns (one for Inv, Recipe, and Store)

PreDayMenu.Display looks funny for the store.

Item(ingredient, not-food){(lemon, sugar, ice), (cup)} multiple inheritance is no good in C#, but stackOverflow says use interfaces. Look into this.
