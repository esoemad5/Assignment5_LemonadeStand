This list is not comprehensive!


The game works! Poorly, but it works! Things to make it more than just functional:
Buy items in bulk
Put restrictions on recipie (sum of lemons and sugar must be in some range). a recipie of 0 lemons, 0 sugar and 0 ice means unlimited lemonade.
Write message for the 'Help' option.

PreDayMenu.Display can be broken down into more basic functions.


Low-priority bugs (fix after MVP is met):
Inventory lists can store the wrong item (ex: I can put Ice into my lemons list). Be careful!

Item.isAnIngredient is unused.


Post-MVP:
End of day: # of lemonades sold, customer satisfaction rate, customer feedback table

End of game: How much money is left, how much lemonade sold, customer satisfaction, play again, etc...

PreDayMenu.Display uses 3 columns (one for Inv, Recipe, and Store)

PreDayMenu.Display looks funny for the store.

Item(ingredient, not-food){(lemon, sugar, ice), (cup)} multiple inheritance is no good in C#, but stackOverflow says use interfaces. Look into this.
